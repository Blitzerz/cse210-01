    This program uses the C# language to create a gathering game called "Greed". Gems and rocks are falling from the sky for the player to catch. If the player catches a gem they earn points. If they catch a rock, they lose points. The player is represented as the "#" sign. The game stops once the player closes the window. Inheritance is used pass the attributes and methods of one class to another, making a parent class and child class. Visual Studio Code is used to write this code.
