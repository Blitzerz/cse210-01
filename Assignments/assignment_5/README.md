    This program uses the C# language to create a chasing game called "Cycle". There are two cycles that each player controls. Players try to cut each other off by leaving trails behind them; the trails grow as they move. If one player runs into the other's trail, they lose and the game ends. Polymorphism is used to override methods to have different bodies of code but with the same name. Visual Studio Code is used to write this code.
