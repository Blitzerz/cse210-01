This program uses the C# language to create a card guessing game called "Hilo". The dealer deals cards and the player guesses if the next card will be higher/lower
than the previous card. Points are added/subtracted based on whether the guesses are correct. Abstraction is used through classes, constructors, attributes, methods,
and instances to make the code simpler. Visual Studio Code is used to write this code.
